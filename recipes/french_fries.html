        <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water prevent them from turning brown</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
        <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
        <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden bown and crispy on all sides, about 7-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate to get rid of the excess oil.</li>
